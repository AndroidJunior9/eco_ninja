**ECO NINJA: A Sustainable Adventure**

🌿🔥🗡️

In the serene world of Eco Ninja, where nature thrives and harmony prevails, you step into the role of a vigilant warrior—a defender of the environment. Armed with your trusty blade, you embark on a mission to safeguard the planet from hazardous threats.

### **How It Works**

🌱 **Hazards Galore**: The screen comes alive with various hazards—plastic bottles, toxic waste, and other harmful objects. These represent the perils our environment faces daily.

🔪 **Swift Slashes**: Your finger becomes the blade. Swipe across the screen to slice through the hazards. Each successful cut ensures that these dangers are neutralized.

🌍 **Keep It Aloft**: But here's the catch: you must prevent any hazard from touching the ground. The Earth deserves better than to bear the weight of our carelessness.

### **Frameworks and Libraries**

- **Flutter**: The canvas upon which our eco-conscious adventure unfolds.
- **Flame**: The fiery engine that powers our game mechanics.
- **Dart**: The language that fuels our code, just like renewable energy fuels our world.
